    <h2>Homemade Pizza</h2>
    <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 Â½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>dd flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Let rest for 5 minutes.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan and spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
